    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid,
          level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a
          meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black
          pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in
          the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked
          through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine,
          until warmed through, about 30 seconds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping
          the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden
          spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture;
          cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes.
          Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to
          2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
